Dear Claims Department,

I am writing to appeal the claim denial for the procedure CPT code 99214 (Office/Outpatient Visit) on behalf of my patient, John Doe. After reviewing his health plan and clinical documentation, I strongly disagree with the reason for this denial.

Upon review of the denial reason, "The service provided has been determined to be Not Medically Necessary based on the information submitted," we believe that the procedure meets our criteria for medical necessity at this time. The patient's history of persistent lower back pain for six months warrants a follow-up visit to assess and manage his condition.

We have thoroughly reviewed John's medical history, including his recent imaging results (lumbar MRI) ordered to rule out disc herniation, which suggests that he is not in an acute phase of his condition. Additionally, his symptoms, including chronic lower back pain, radicular symptoms in the right leg, and decreased sensation noted in the right leg, indicate a need for further evaluation.

We respectfully request that you reconsider this denial decision and approve the claim for the procedure as currently billed. We would be happy to provide any additional information or clarification regarding John's medical condition and treatment plan.

Please find attached our patient's visit notes and medical records for your review and consideration. We appreciate your attention to this matter, and we look forward to a prompt response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
