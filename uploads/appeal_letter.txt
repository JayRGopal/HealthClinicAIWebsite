Dear Claims Department,

Re: Appeal of Denial of CPT Code 99214 (Office/Outpatient Visit) for John Doe

I am writing to appeal the denial of my claim for office visit services provided on October 3, 2024, for patient John Doe. As per our facility's review and analysis, the procedure in question did not meet our criteria for medical necessity at this time.

After reviewing the relevant documentation, including the patient's history, examination results, and treatment plan, we determined that a lumbar MRI was ordered to rule out disc herniation as the cause of John Doe's chronic lower back pain. The lack of conclusive evidence supporting the need for the procedure and the absence of a significant change in his medical condition render this treatment medically unnecessary.

I would like to highlight that John Doe has been experiencing persistent lower back pain, which he reports has been ongoing for six months. Despite our efforts to address this through physical therapy and conservative management strategies, the symptoms have not improved significantly. Our clinical judgment suggests that the procedure is unlikely to provide substantial benefit in this case.

In accordance with HealthFirst Insurance's appeal process, I respectfully request that you review this decision and reconsider our initial determination. Please find attached my patient visit notes, which provide a detailed account of John Doe's condition, treatment plan, and medical history.

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this matter further with your team and answer any questions you may have. If there is any additional information or documentation required to support our appeal, please let me know promptly.

Thank you for considering our appeal. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
Medical Director
