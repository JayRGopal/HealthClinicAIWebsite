You can achieve this by combining role‐based access control (RBAC) with a proper storage solution for your posts. Here’s a high‑level overview of a recommended approach:

Restricting Access with Clerk:

Use Clerk’s user metadata or custom claims to assign a “role” (e.g. “admin” or “editor”) to the startup team members.
On the blog post creation route (or component), check the user’s role (using server-side checks, middleware, or protected server actions) and only render the “create post” UI for those who have the right role.
Storing Blog Posts:

Even if your blog posts are low volume, a database is ideal for storing post metadata (titles, content, publication status, upload URLs from Uploadthing, etc.) and makes it easier to add features like editing, deleting, or draft management.
While you could use file‑based storage (like markdown files) for a simple static blog, a database offers more flexibility and scalability in a production app.
Admin Page/Dashboard:

It’s a good practice to implement an admin (or dashboard) page that’s accessible only to authorized users.
This page can list posts and provide interfaces for creating, updating, or deleting posts—all protected by server‑side role checks.
In summary:
Use Clerk’s role management to restrict who can create posts, store your blog data in a database (to track posts and their metadata), and optionally build a secure admin page for managing posts. This approach not only keeps your content secure and editable by only the startup team but also sets up your app for future scalability.
